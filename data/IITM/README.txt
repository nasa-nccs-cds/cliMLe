Longest Instrumental Rainfall Series of the Indian Regions (1813-2006)

Long period instrumental rainfall series is vital for climate studies. Longest possible instrumental area-averaged monthly, seasonal and annual rainfall series of seven homogeneous zones and the whole India have been developed using highly quality-controlled data from well spread network of 316 raingauge stations. For the period 1901-2006 with complete data of all the stations, the area-averaged series has been prepared from simple arithmetic mean of the gauges in the particular area, and for the period prior to 1901 (sometimes going back to 1813) with lesser available observations the series is constructed by applying theoretically vindicated objective method.

The details of construction prior to 1901 and the full period monthly, seasonal and annual rainfall data for the seven homogeneous zones and all India are provided here in Table 2 to Table 9 (Holocene, 2008). For North Mountainous India (NMI) the construction details and the rainfall sequence are given in Table 2(a), and Table 2(b), for the Northwest India (NWI) are given in Table 3(a) and 3(b), for the North Central India (NCI) in Table 4(a) and 4(b), for the Northeast India (NEI) in Table 5(a) and 5(b), for the West Peninsular India (WPI) in Table 6(a) and 6(b), for the East Peninsular India (EPI) in Table 7(a) and 7(b), for the South Peninsular India (SPI) in Table 8(a) and 8(b) and for the whole country in Table 9(a) and 9(b) respectively. The data can be downloaded.
